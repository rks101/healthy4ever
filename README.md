Stay healthy forever so you can do more


## Desk stretching execises 

Your health is very important, espcially eyes, neck, back, fingers and wrists if you type a lot or frequently. If you are using a computer desktop (with mouse), laptop, tablet or phone for three hours or more every day, repetitive strain injury may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad posture, if ignored for long, can cause fatigue and pain later.    

Please take a break often from displays, do exercises, stretches (even while in office). This page from [Princeton Univ Health Services](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help in simple reflexes, especially watch videos under section Desk Stretching Exercises.

## Know your body 

It is good if you know your body well. You may be living in a perfect healthy body and you may be doing yoga, exercises, walk or running, cycling, swimming, etc. to stay fit. That's good! It is also important to know something about our eyes, neck, back, spine, hands, heart, etc.
