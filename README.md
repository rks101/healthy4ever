Stay healthy forever so you can do better.  

## Get up early in the morning 

Develop a habit of getting up early; make it a routine or your own universal law, even on Sundays and holidays. It may be 4 am for someone, 5 or 6 am for others, or something like that. It is important to be regular. You can do many things even before many around you are not yet up and still asleep. Our body gets tired after work or no work during the day; it needs repairs, so sleep early and get up early afresh. One can do more with 7-8 hours of sleep in the night and a few breaks in the day, and yet we have a majority of 24 hours left.    

One needs to wake up longer to cover up - a big NO. Students or engineers cannot sleep early or see; others are still awake online, so we should work more - none of this has any scientifically proven base or medicinal evidence or proven published work in engineering that may be helping everyone. With regular and steady habits, one can sustain.

## Walk or run often  

As your body allows (you can train your body), go for a long walk or run often. Prefer interval walk and run a little, again walk and run a little, if you are just starting. The most important thing: never do too much in a day because it will hurt your muscles and leg pieces, especially if you have not been doing this for a reasonably long time. Increase the total distance gradually over many days and weeks, the same as cycling. You can extend a little more on Sundays and holidays. A break from work does not mean a break from good habits or exercise. Avoid highways and very busy roads, and prefer on soil type surface over hard cement/concrete or damaged roads. 

The more, the better is a big NO. Understand that over-stretching or hurting your body by doing more or extra in a short span of time - cannot yield better results in the long term. Yes, one should push a little in a very gentle way to improve endurance and stamina gradually over a period of time.

## Do stretches and exercises 

Your health is very important. Your eyes, neck, back, fingers, and wrists need special care if you frequently do repetitive manual or mechanical work. If you use a computer desktop (with mouse), laptop, tablet, or phone for three hours or more every day, repetitive strain injuries may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad posture, if ignored for long, can cause fatigue and pain and get bad later on.    

Please take a break often from displays, exercise, and stretch (even while in the office). This page from [Princeton Univ Health Services](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help with simple reflexes, especially watching videos under the section Desk Stretching Exercises.

## Know your body 

It is good if you know your body well. You may be living in a perfectly healthy body, and you may be doing yoga, exercises, walking or running, cycling, swimming, etc., to stay fit. That's good! It is also important to know something about our eyes, neck, back, spine, hands, heart, etc.    

Note:- Do not worry or get stressed while you read the pages below. Just be aware that something like this exists in biology or our human anatomy books.

Bad posture while typing or similar repetitive strain **may cause** Nerve Compression or Cervical Radiculopathy \cite[CR](https://www.spineuniverse.com/anatomy/cervical-spine-anatomy-neck) or [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet).    

Give enough rest to hands and wrists, and do reflexes within your personal range. When you are sitting in front of your computer desktop/laptop, your eyes should be directed at the top one-third of your computer display. If you have to look up or down, adjust your display/monitor so that you can sit comfortably without straining your neck.     

Get up from the seat often and take enough liquid (water/juices/tea) throughout the day.

## Do something that brings focus 

It may sound strange, yet it is something that many of us are doing knowingly or in a subconscious state. It is also a way to "let it go". Just do something that brings a focus such that you are doing exactly one thing; keep thoughts enlightening you.    

e.g. 
- Some sports activities are better, such as outdoor playing, swimming, chess, etc.    
- something like a quick break from routine, cooking a meal or part of it, preparing some soup/tea/coffee, etc.   
- writing a book, poem, or blog, compiling text/songs already written, etc.   
- yoga, meditation, exercise, or something closer to that.   
- music, music, and music in any form.    
- a type of movie you like, a type of movie you have never seen before. Change is always good.    

Do not count mindless scrolling pages while browsing, binging over videos, spending hours on so-called "social sites", etc.

## Lesser dependency on meds 

One should reduce the intake of medicines in a year unless a genetic disorder or a medical condition since birth or as strongly advised by Doctors and well-being experts.     

Any medical practitioner will advise you that almost every medicine has one or more side effects if you ask them for side effects. Even paracetamol or cold or body-ache-related generic medicines have documented side effects. Do not panic. Just reduce your dependence on medicines by methods that can help.     

- Deep breath: take a deep breath, hold it for 3 seconds, and release. While releasing, feel your body relaxing and toxic things are going out. Repeat this a few times.   
- Water: nothing tastes like water. Consume enough water every single day and stay well hydrated.    
- Tea/coffee: love them, have them. Just reduce the size of cuppa :) and daily frequency, avoid a few hours before sleep.     
- Sugar/sweets: you need natural sugar for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help with the quantity and type of intake. You decide on sweets on birthdays, anniversaries, festivals, etc.; You decide whether candy or chocolates can hurt your teeth.     
- Fat/oil/ghee: you need natural fats for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help with the quantity and type of intake. You decide on oily, fried, and other stuff as you binge on them.    

Now, please do not throw away your meds or tell your parents in their 60s/70s/80s. Take meds when you need them as prescribed by the Doctors and well-being experts.

## Mental well-being   

Mental well-being is important. We do not realize this until we or someone near us goes through this. No one walks to a store, or purchases stress online. Do you? Yet many young individuals experience icebergs hitting their mental-titanic often. May be because of constraints of given time, space, manpower resources, lack of trust in relationships or in others, not addressing route cause often, trying to keep a tight leash on matters with or without control, insecurities, trauma, etc.      

Stress or anxiety can result from our thoughts, habits, how we are dealing with our daily routine, everything that comes our way, and our response to it. It is natural to get "dirt" accumulated over a period of time; we need to clean it just like we do our rooms. Stress can increase with being alone, isolation, or unpleasant commentary, so there is a need to change something in our lives.    

First, it's going to be okay.    

Second, seek professional help from Clinical Psychologists and well-being experts to work on your health. Make them your friend! Never hesitate to share or seek help. Just do not tell every person you meet in the day because they are not trained to deal with it.      

Third, you are not going to lose anything in your career or life by telling your condition. Hiding and not seeking help may not help you either. Your own health is more important now than anything you have or do not have.     

Fourth, more often log these in a diary or paper and share with your well-being expert whenever you can:   

- your sleep timings and quality of sleep,
- your food intake, constipation, stomach upset, injuries, etc.
- daily activities or routine, physical activity, surroundings,
- how are you feeling on some days and times and why it is so,
- recent events or anything that bothers you in particular, trauma or unpleasant events in the past,
- What makes you feel happy, turns you off, triggers your reaction, etc., and why do you feel so?

Know about and seek professional medical advice on anxiety attack, migrane headaches, recurring mental fatigue, etc. Do not ignore them; these can be sign of other health conditions.
