## Get up early in the morning 

Develop a habit of getting up early; make it a routine or your own universal law, even on Sundays and holidays. It may be 4 am for someone, 5 am or 6 am for others, or something like that. It is important to be regular. You can do many things even before many around you are not yet up and still asleep. Our body gets tired after work or no work during the day; it needs repairs, so sleep early and get up early afresh. One can do more with 7-8 hours of sleep at night and a few breaks in the day, yet we have a majority of 24 hours left.    

One needs to wake up longer to cover up - a big NO. The body and eyes get exhausted and need repairs. Students or engineers cannot sleep early, or others are still awake online, so we should also stay awake longer - NO. Being regular and with steady habits, one can sustain longer.

## Walk or run often  

As your body allows (and you can train your body), go for a long walk or run often. Prefer interval walk and run a little, again walk and run a little, if you are just starting. The most important thing: never do too much in a day because it will hurt your muscles and leg pieces, especially if you have not been doing this for a reasonably long time. Increase the total distance to walk or run gradually over several days and weeks, the same as cycling. You can extend a little more on Sundays and holidays. A break from work does not mean a break from good habits or exercise. Avoid highways and very busy roads; prefer soil-type surfaces over hard cement/concrete or damaged roads.   

The more, the better - is a big NO. Understand that over-stretching or hurting your body by doing more or extra in a short span of time - cannot yield better results in the long term. Yes, one should push a little in a very gentle way to improve endurance and stamina gradually over a period of time (several days and weeks).

## Do stretches and exercises 

Your health is very important. Continuous sitting, standing, or being in the same position over long hours is not good. Your eyes, neck, back, fingers, and wrists need special care if you frequently do repetitive manual or mechanical work. If you use a computer desktop (with mouse), laptop, tablet, or phone for three hours or more every day, repetitive strain injuries may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. If ignored for long, a bad posture can cause fatigue and pain and get bad later on.    

So, what is to be done? Please take a break often from displays (desktop/laptop/tablet/mobile/TV), do some exercises, and stretch, also while in the office. This page from [Princeton Univ Health Services](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help with simple reflexes, especially watching videos under the section Desk Stretching Exercises.

## Know your body 

It is good if you know your body well. You may be living in a perfectly healthy body and doing yoga, exercises, walking or running, cycling, swimming, etc., to stay fit. That's good! It is also important to know something about our eyes, neck, back, spine, hands, heart, etc. A bad posture or sitting habit can hurt after years.    

Note:- Do not worry or get stressed while you read the pages below. Just be aware that something like this exists in biology and in our human anatomy books.

Bad posture while typing or similar repetitive strain may cause Nerve Compression or Cervical Radiculopathy [CR](https://www.spineuniverse.com/anatomy/cervical-spine-anatomy-neck) or [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet). This may start with tingling in fingers or palm and shooting pain in pores or wrists.     

Give enough rest to hands and wrists often, and do reflexes within your personal range. When you are sitting in front of your computer desktop/laptop, your eyes should be directed at the top one-third of your computer display. If you have to look up or down, adjust your display/monitor so that you can sit comfortably without straining your neck.     

Get up from the seat often and take enough liquid (water/juices/tea) throughout the day.

## Do something that brings focus 

It may sound strange, yet it is something that many of us are doing knowingly or in a subconscious state. It is also a way to "let it go". Just do something that brings a focus such that you are doing exactly one thing for an hour; keep your thoughts enlightening you.    

e.g. 
- Some sports activities are better, such as outdoor playing, swimming, chess, guitar, etc.    
- something like a quick break from routine, cooking a meal or part of it, preparing some soup/tea/coffee, etc.   
- writing a book, poem, or blog, compiling text/songs already written, etc.   
- yoga, meditation, exercise, or something closer to that.   
- music, music, and music in any form.    
- read a book.    
- a type of movie you like, a type of movie you have never seen before. Change is always good.    

Do not count on mindless scrolling pages while browsing, binging over videos; reality shows selling their filmed stories, or spending hours on so-called "social sites", etc. They may act like heroin/drug; you crave more after the effect is neutralized or gone!

## Lesser dependency on meds 

One should reduce the intake of medicines unless it is a genetic disorder, a medical condition since birth, or as strongly advised by Doctors and well-being experts.    

Any medical practitioner will advise you that almost every conventional medicine has one or more side effects if you ask them for side effects. Even common cold or body-ache-related generic medicines can have side effects. Do not panic. Just reduce your dependence on medicines and antibiotics. Go with advice and methods that can help us with lesser medicines. Take care when the weather changes from warm to cold or cold to warm.     

- Deep breath: take a deep breath, hold it for 3 seconds, and release. While releasing, feel your body relaxing and toxic things are going out. Repeat this a few times.   
- Water: nothing tastes like water. Consume enough water every single day, even during winter, and stay well hydrated.    
- Tea/coffee: love them, have them. Just reduce the size of cuppa :) and daily frequency, avoid a few hours before sleep.     
- Sugar/sweets: you need natural sugar for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help with the quantity and type of intake. You decide on sweets on birthdays, anniversaries, festivals, etc.; You decide whether candy or chocolates can hurt your teeth.     
- Fat/oil/ghee: you need natural fats for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help with the quantity and type of intake. You decide on oily, fried, and other stuff as you binge on them.    

Now, please do not throw away your meds or tell your parents in their 60s/70s/80s. Take meds when you need them as prescribed by the Doctors and well-being experts.

## Mental wellbeing   

Mental well-being is important. We may not realize this until we or someone near us has gone through this. No one walks into a store, or purchases stress online. Do you?    

Yet many individuals experience "anxiety" or "stress" icebergs hitting their mental-titanic often. It may be because of self-talk, over-thinking, constraints of given time, space, and resources, lack of trust in relationships or in people, taking yourself too seriously, trying to keep tight control on matters, compulsions, insecurities, trauma, etc.      

Stress or anxiety can result from our thoughts, habits, how we are dealing with our daily routine, everything that comes our way, and our response to it. It is natural to get "dirt" accumulated over a period of time; we need to clean it just like we do our rooms. Stress can increase with being alone, isolation, or unpleasant commentary (taking too seriously), so there is a need to change something in our lives.    

First, it's going to be okay. When something good does not last forever, so shall off days.     

Second, seek professional help from Clinical Psychologists and well-being experts to work on your health. Make them your friend! Never hesitate to share or seek help. Just do not tell every person you meet in the day because they are not trained to deal with it.      

Third, you are not going to lose anything in your career or life by telling your condition. Hiding and not seeking help may not help you either. Your own health is more important now than anything you have or do not have. Your workplace or colleagues can treat you differently, give you a tough time, or hold grudges. Just ignore all this small stuff as you can and forgive them by saying, "I forgive X, Y, Z; they do not know my state". Draw boundaries for someone being firm or harsh, being strong or bully [Dr Kalam in Wings of Fire]. It won't matter soon; take small breaks. Do not make big decisions for some time that can matter. Be grateful for all you have in this life. Visit a hospital emergency-ward/cemetery/Kabristan - they tell us what remains and how beautiful life is. Embrace sunlight and flowers - they do not manipulate us.     

Fourth, more often log these in a diary or paper and share with your well-being expert whenever you can:   

- your sleep timings and quality of sleep,
- your food intake, constipation, stomach upset, injuries, etc.
- daily activities or routine, physical activity, surroundings,
- how are you feeling on some days and times and why it is so,
- recent events or anything that bothers you in particular, trauma or unpleasant events in the past,
- What makes you feel happy, turns you off, triggers your reaction, etc., and why do you feel so?
- log your smoking, drinking, or any kind of drug or sudden changes in the intake.

Know about and seek professional medical advice on anxiety attacks, migraine headaches, recurring mental fatigue, etc. Do not ignore them; these can be signs of other health conditions.
