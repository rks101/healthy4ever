Stay healthy forever so you can do more. 

## Get up early in the morning 

Develop a habit to get up early, make it a routine or your own universal law, so even on Sundays and holidays. It may be 4 am for someone, 5 am for others or something like that. It is important to be regular. You can do many things even before many around you are not yet up and still asleep. Our body gets tired up after work or no-work in the day, it needs repairs, so sleep early and get up early afresh. One can do more with 6-7 hours of sleep in the night and a few breaks in the day, and yet we have a majority of 24 hours left.    

One need to wake up longer to cover up - a big NO. Students or engineers cannot sleep early or see, others are still awake online so we should work more - none of this has any scientifically proven base or medicinal evidence or proven published work in engineering that may be helping everyone. With regular and steady habits, one can sustain.     

## Walk or run often  

As your body allows (you can train your body), go into habit of going for a long walk or run often. Prefer interval walk and run a little, again walk and run a little, if you are just starting. Most important thing: never do too much in a day because it will hurt your muscles and leg piece especially if you have not been doing this for a reasonably long time. Increase the total distance gradually over many days and weeks, same as cycling. You can extend a little more on Sundays and holidays. Break from work does not mean break from good habits or exercise. Avoid highways and very busy roads, and prefer on soil type surface over hard cement/concrete or damaged roads. 

The more the better - is a big NO here. Understand that over-stretching or hurting your body by doing more or extra in a short span of time - cannot yield better results in the long term. Yes, one should push a little in a very gentle way to improve the endurance and stamina gradually over a period of time.     

## Do stretches and execises 

Your health is very important. Your eyes, neck, back, fingers and wrists need special care if you are in job with repetitive manual or mechanical work frequently. If you are using a computer desktop (with mouse), laptop, tablet or phone for three hours or more every day, repetitive strain injuries may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad posture, if ignored for long, can cause fatigue, pain and get bad later on.    

Please take a break often from displays, do exercises, stretches (even while in office). This page from [Princeton Univ Health Services](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help in simple reflexes, especially watch videos under section Desk Stretching Exercises.

## Know your body 

It is good if you know your body well. You may be living in a perfect healthy body and you may be doing yoga, exercises, walk or running, cycling, swimming, etc. to stay fit. That's good! It is also important to know something about our eyes, neck, back, spine, hands, heart, etc.    

Note:- Do not worry or get stressed while you read the pages below. Just be aware of something like this exists in biology or our human anatomy books.

Bad posture while typing or similar repetitive strain **may cause** Nerve Compression or Cervical Radiculopathy \cite[CR](https://www.spineuniverse.com/anatomy/cervical-spine-anatomy-neck) or [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet).    

Give enough rest to hands, wrists, do reflexes within your personal range. When you are sitting in front of your computer desktop/laptop, your eyes should be directed at the top one-third of your computer display. If you have to look up or down, adjust your display/monitor such that you can sit comfortably without straining your neck.     

Get up from the seat often and take enough liquid (water/juices/tea) throughut the day.   

## Do something that brings focus 

It may sound strange, yet it is something that many of us are doing knowingly or in sub-consciecous state. It is also a way to "let-it-go". Just do something that brings a focus such that you are doing exactly one thing, keep thoughts enlightening you.    

e.g. some sport activity better playing yourself, swimming, chess, etc.    
e.g. something like a quick break from routine, cooking a meal or part of it, preparing some soup/tea/coffeee, etc.   
e.g. writing a book, a poem, a blog, compile text/songs already written, etc.   
e.g. yoga, meditation, exercise or something closer to that.   
e.g. music, music, and music in any form.    
e.g. a type of movie you like, a type of movie you never seen before. Change is always good.    

Do not count mindless scrolling pages while browsing, binging over videos, spending hours on so called "social sites", etc.    

## Lesser dependency on meds 

One should reduce intake of medicines in a year unless a genetic disorder or a medical condition since birth.    

Any medical practitioner will advise you that almost every medicine has one or more side effects if you ask them for side effects. Even paracetamol or cold or body ache related generic medicines have documented side effects. Do not panic. Just reduce your dependence on medicines by methods that can help.     

Water: nothing tastes like water. Consume enough water every single day.      
Tea/coffee: love them, have them. Just reduce the size of cuppa :) and daily frequency, avoid a few hours before sleep.     
Sugar/sweets: you need natural sugar for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help on the quantity and type of intake. You decide for sweets on birthday, festivals, etc., Candy or chocolates can hurt your teeth or no.     
Fat/oil/ghee: you need natural fats for energy and in moderation. Doctors can help on the quantity and type of intake. You decide for fried and other stuff as you binge on them.    

Now, please do not throw away your meds or tell your parents in their 60s/70s/80s. Take meds when you need them.
