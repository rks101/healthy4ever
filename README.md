Stay healthy forever so you can do more. 

## Get up early in the morning 

Develop a habit to get up early, make it a routine or your own universal law, so even on Sundays and holidays.   
It may be 4 am for someone, 5 am for others or something like that. It is important to be regular.   
You can do many things even before many around you are not yet up and still asleep.   

## Walk or run often  

As your body allows (you can train your body), go into habit of going for a long walk or run often. Prefer interval walk and run a little, again walk and run a little, if you are just starting. Most important thing: never do too much in a day because it will hurt your muscles and leg piece especially if you have not been doing this for a reasonably long time. Increase the total distance gradually over many days and weeks, same as cycling. You can extend a little more on Sundays and holidays. Break from work does not mean break from good habits or exercise. Avoid highways and very busy roads, and prefer on soil type surface over hard cement/concrete or damaged roads.     

## Do stretches and execises 

Your health is very important. Your eyes, neck, back, fingers and wrists need special care if you are in job with repetitive manual or mechanical work frequently. If you are using a computer desktop (with mouse), laptop, tablet or phone for three hours or more every day, repetitive strain injuries may affect your fingers, wrists, neck, back, and eyes. Merely a bad posture, if ignored for long, can cause fatigue, pain and get bad later on.    

Please take a break often from displays, do exercises, stretches (even while in office). This page from [Princeton Univ Health Services](https://uhs.princeton.edu/health-resources/ergonomics-computer-use) can help in simple reflexes, especially watch videos under section Desk Stretching Exercises.

## Know your body 

It is good if you know your body well. You may be living in a perfect healthy body and you may be doing yoga, exercises, walk or running, cycling, swimming, etc. to stay fit. That's good! It is also important to know something about our eyes, neck, back, spine, hands, heart, etc.    

Note:- Do not worry while you read the pages below. Just be aware of something like this exists.

Bad posture while typing or similar repetitive strain **may cause** Nerve Compression or Cervical Radiculopathy \cite[CR](https://www.spineuniverse.com/anatomy/cervical-spine-anatomy-neck) or [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Carpal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet).    

Give enough rest to hands, wrists, do reflexes within your personal range. When you are sitting in front of your computer desktop/laptop, your eyes should be directed at the top one-third of your computer display. If you have to look up or down, adjust your display/monitor such that you can sit comfortably without straining your neck.     

Get up from the seat often and take enough liquid (water/juices/tea) throughut the day.
